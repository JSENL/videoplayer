Feature: click instructional step to see video clip
As a visitor
I can click an instructional step
So that I can watch a related video clip.

Scenario: (this part will come later)

As an author
I need to make sure the <span id= video-id>
has the correct link in the span.
So that the link in the Span is correct or the video
will not load and will show the following:

Invalid parameters Failed to load resource: the server
responded with a status of 404 ()

As an author
I need to make sure the 4th step of the js in the Youtube API
(// 4. The API will call this function when the video player is ready.)
has the correct timed seconds,
So that if the video is shorter than the seconds inputted in,
the video will go to the end and not work.

Discussion: (note that this part is 'commented out'; we won't always need discussion but it can be good to save it with the story when it helps clarify)
- the user story doesn't distinguish between videos; if there are 14 steps on a given page, the clips could be from 14 different videos or from 4 or from 1
